This simulation models the energy generation process of a helium gravitational generator. Here's a detailed description of what the simulation does:

Objective
The goal is to simulate a cyclic process where a weight is lifted and then allowed to fall, generating energy through a generator. The process considers various phases of energy transformation and calculates the total energy and torque generated over a specified number of cycles.

Class: HeliumGravitationalGenerator
Attributes:
weight: The mass of the object being lifted and dropped, in kilograms.
helium_chamber_volume: Volume of the helium chamber, in cubic meters.
generator_efficiency: Efficiency of the generator, represented as a decimal (e.g., 0.80 for 80% efficiency).
fall_distance: Distance the object falls, in meters.
gravity_constant: The gravitational constant, set to 9.81 m/s².
Methods:
potential_energy(height): Calculates the potential energy of the object at a given height.
kinetic_potential_energy(): Calculates the potential energy based on the fall distance.
simulate_cyclic_process(num_cycles): Simulates the lifting and falling process for a specified number of cycles.
Simulation Process:
Initialization: Sets up the initial conditions, including the weight, helium chamber volume, generator efficiency, fall distance, and gravitational constant.
Energy Calculations:
Potential Energy Calculation: During the lifting phase, potential energy is calculated based on the height (fall distance).
Kinetic Energy Calculation: During the falling phase, the final velocity, radius of rotation, moment of inertia, and angular velocity are calculated to determine the kinetic energy.
Energy Generation:
Work Done: Calculates the work done during the falling phase.
Total Energy Generated: Adds the potential energy and kinetic energy, then multiplies by the generator efficiency to find the total energy generated in joules.
Torque Calculation: Calculates the torque generated during the process.
Energy Slippage: Deducts 20% of the total energy generated due to slippage from the compressor.
Output:
Prints the total energy generated before and after slippage.
Prints the energy lost due to slippage.
Prints the total torque generated.
Prints the equivalent energy in Newton-meters.
Example Usage:
An example usage of the simulation is provided, where a weight of 5000 kg is used, with a helium chamber volume of 10 m³, generator efficiency of 80%, fall distance of 20 meters, and the process is simulated for 1 cycle.

The simulation provides insights into the energy and torque generated by the helium gravitational generator over multiple cycles, taking into account efficiency and energy losses.
